# Constantinople
## Background
This is just a fun project I decided to try after doing an online Java course.
The idea comes from a code system used by MI5 to commnunicate with a British double agent 'Agent ZigZag' during the second world war.
An explanation of the code system is detailed [here](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=s2Nx4pjHcUEC&pg=PT324&lpg=PT324&dq=chapman%27s+code+mi5+constantinople&source=bl&ots=HMC6RMZv8c&sig=ACfU3U2qBCu8WvnkgTVCvYF5ZLEvroaAEQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiD6eapoq73AhW6TmwGHVXgAZkQ6AF6BAgfEAM#v=onepage&q&f=false).

## What it does
A command line application that asks the user for a codeword, the day of the month, and a message to encode or decode.
The program then outputs the message in its decoded or encoded form. The message is encoded and decoded using the same technique employedd in Chapman's code.
